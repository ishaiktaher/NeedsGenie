✨ NeedsGenie

NeedsGenie is a requirement-first marketplace that connects users with verified Industry Specialists (brokers, agents, consultants, and professionals) who can fulfil their needs quickly, reliably, and transparently.

Instead of users searching endlessly across listings and classifieds, NeedsGenie flips the model:

Users post requirements → Specialists respond with intent.

🚀 Vision

To become the most trusted platform where any requirement — property, rentals, vehicles, finance, industrial spaces, or professional services — is fulfilled by the right specialist within minutes.
